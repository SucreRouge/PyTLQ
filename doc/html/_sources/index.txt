PyTLQ: A Python Package for Solving Temporal Logic Queries
==========================================================

PyTLQ is an original Python package for solving temporal logic queries, as
defined by Chan [1] and corrected/extended by Samer and Veith [2, 3].

Temporal logic query solving is an extension of model checking whose main aim
is to understand a model as opposed to merely verifying its correctness. A
temporal logic query basically consists of a temporal logic formula where
some subformulas are replaced by the special symbol ``?`` representing a "hole"
in the formula. The query solving problem then consists of finding the right
subformula to fill the hole(s) and make the initial formula satisfied in the
considered modeled system.

PyTLQ can therefore be seen as an extension of the PyNuSMV model-checking
library [4]. Within this framework, it uses the BDD-based model checking
functionalities of the latter to efficiently implement temporal logic queries.

PyTLQ uses `PyNuSMV <http://lvl.info.ucl.ac.be/Tools/PyNuSMV>`_,
`PyParsing <https://pyparsing.wikispaces.com>`_, and
`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/4/>`_ as dependencies.

This documentation provides the complete package API as well as a guide
which will get you started in working with PyTLQ.
